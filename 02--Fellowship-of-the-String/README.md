# Fellowship of the String

## Rituals (~1h 15m)

* **Standup Meeting** (~15m)
* **Three Little Things** (~30m)
* **Homework Review** (~30m)

## Agenda

### Review

* What _primitive types_ exist in JavaScript?
* What is an Expression?
  * What is the simplest Expression?
  * What is an Operator? What does an Operator require?
  * What is the result of an Operation? Expression!
* What is a Statement?
  * What Operator do we use to denote a Statement?
  * What other Operators can separate Statements?
  * Can a Statement contain more than one Expression?
* What other kinds of Statements are there?

### All about Functions

* What is a Function?
  * How is a Function defined? How is a defined Function invoked?
  * What is the input? How does a function accept input?
  * What is the output? How does a function provide output?
  * What are side-effects? How does a function create side-effects?
* Do I always have to write my own Functions?
  * What functions are built-in to JavaScript?
  * Is there any other way to define or invoke a Function?
  * What is an anonymous function? What is it used for?
    * examples with `setTimeout`, `setInterval`
* How does this relate to Control Flow and the Rule of Sequential Operation?

## A little more about Control Flow

* How do I alter the Control Flow of a program?
  * How do I _draw_ a decision tree? How do I _write_ one?
  * What if I have more than one decision to make?
  * How do I draw that?
* What if I need to make the same decision again?

### Coding Kata: String Calculator

### Back to the `git` cave! ! (~30m)
  * What did we change? -- `git status`
  * No, really. -- `git diff`
  * Time to commit!
  * Pushing to a Remote
