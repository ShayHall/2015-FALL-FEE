### The Right Mindset

Continue working on your essay, now progressing in the Revision phase. You should start to produce a Final Draft starting with the best parts of your Roughs. Edit and expand them with a series of revisions, which you save as commits in Github. You should keep your old Roughs and Outline around.

### Reading JavaScript: Control Flow

Using the following resources from MDN and your own research, describe [the control flow and error handling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Control_flow_and_error_handling) constructs: `{ }` as a block operator, `if`, `else`, `switch/case`, `try/catch`, and `throw`. Then read and cover [the looping and iteration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration) keywords: `for`, `while`, and `do/while`.
