### 00 -- Ready Player One

[Create an Issue in the class repo (this one)](../issues/new) and name it `00 -- YOUR NAME`, where `YOUR NAME` is, well... your name. If you copy and paste the checklist from the **Tasks** sections below into the **Description** of your issue _as is_, you should end up with a bunch of checkboxes, just like these, thanks to [the way that GitHub interprets Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). As you complete tasks, check off the corresponding checkboxes and watch your progress bar fill! Read [Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) for more information on creating issues in GitHub.

## Extracurricular Activities

Regardless of how good you think you are at typing, a lot of the mistakes you make at first will be simple typographic errors. If you _don't_ know how to touch type (i.e. without looking at the keyboard), start practicing _now_ with http://www.keybr.com/. If you're fairly confident in your typing ability, try working through the JavaScript lessons on http://typing.io

There are two books that I suggest you start reading. They're both avaialble in digital format on various devices, and they're both relatively easy reads:

* [_Getting Things Done_ by David Allen](http://j.mp/134jABk)
* [_Pragmatic Thinking and Learning_ by Andy Hunt](http://j.mp/1D5nmu8)
